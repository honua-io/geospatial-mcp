# MCP Resource Contracts

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Scope:** Per-family resource contracts for the geospatial MCP standard

This document extends [Taxonomy, Capability Matrix, and Non-Goals](taxonomy.md)
with the concrete MCP resource contracts operators and downstream consumers
need to inspect result packages, map and app assets, styles, themes,
templates, and promotion-oriented surfaces. Taxonomy stays the single source
of truth for vocabulary and the v1 capability matrix; this document adds the
per-family URI grammar, inspection fields, lifecycle visibility, and
relationship graph that build on that baseline.

## Boundary Restatement

MCP resources are the **inspection projection** of canonical server-side
objects. The MCP vs gRPC vs server-internal split from
[taxonomy.md](taxonomy.md#mcp-role-in-the-architecture) applies verbatim:

1. MCP resources surface read-only views. They never mutate server state.
2. Execution, promotion, approval gating, and deployment control stay with
   gRPC services and server-internal workflows.
3. Canonical shapes are owned by `honua-server` and referenced here, not
   redefined.

The boundary table is not repeated; see
[taxonomy.md §MCP Role in the Architecture](taxonomy.md#mcp-role-in-the-architecture).

## Resource URI Conventions

All MCP resources use the `honua://` scheme. The grammar is:

```
honua://{family}[/{id}[/{subfamily}/{subid}]*]
```

The `{id}` segment is omitted when addressing a family-level collection
root. The open-core data-access surface already exposes the collection
resource `honua://services` (see
[MCP_SERVER.md §Exposed MCP Resources](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/MCP_SERVER.md#exposed-mcp-resources));
that resource remains valid under this grammar. Families introduced by
this document address instance resources (and their subresources) only;
they do not redefine collection roots.

Families introduced by this document:

| Family | URI form | Canonical source |
|---|---|---|
| Result package | `honua://results/{result_package_id}` | `AnalysisResultPackage`, `PublishingResultPackage`, `BuilderResultPackage` |
| Result artifact (outcome view) | `honua://results/{result_package_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}` | `ArtifactRef` |
| Result provenance | `honua://results/{result_package_id}/provenance` | `ProvenanceRecord` |
| Map package | `honua://maps/{map_package_id}` | `MapPackage` |
| App package | `honua://apps/{app_package_id}` | `AppPackage` |
| Style | `honua://styles/{style_id}` | `StyleRef` |
| Theme | `honua://themes/{theme_id}` | `ThemeSpec` |
| Map template | `honua://templates/maps/{map_template_id}` | `MapTemplate` |
| App template | `honua://templates/apps/{app_template_id}` | `AppPackage.templateId` (shape deferred) |
| Published service | `honua://services/{published_service_id}` | `PublishedService` |
| Deployment | `honua://deployments/{deployment_id}` | `Deployment` |
| Workspace | `honua://workspaces/{workspace_id}` | `WorkspaceRef` |
| Workspace artifact (lifecycle view) | `honua://workspaces/{workspace_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}` | `ArtifactRef` |

ID prefixes follow the canonical examples in
[AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md):
`result_`, `map_`, `app_`, `style_`, `theme_`, `svc_`, `dep_`, `ws_`,
`artifact_`, `rev_`. Template IDs are stable registry-defined identifiers
(for example `analysis_default`, `analysis_dashboard`) surfaced through
`templateId`; this document does not mandate an MCP-local prefix convention
for templates.

The open-core data-access surface already uses
`honua://services/{encodedServiceId}/layers/{layerId}` for catalog-backed
layer schema inspection (see
[MCP_SERVER.md](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/MCP_SERVER.md)).
`honua://services/{published_service_id}` coexists with that usage: the
former is operator-published service metadata, the latter is a layer schema
view. Both resolve under a single scheme; clients distinguish by path.

## Result Package Resources

### `honua://results/{result_package_id}`

Inspection projection of
[`AnalysisResultPackage`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#analysisresultpackage).
The canonical shape is authoritative; MCP surfaces a read-only view.

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `resultPackageId` | Stable identifier (`result_…`) |
| `status` | `GeoprocessingWorkflowStatus` (read-only) |
| `summary` | Title and description |
| `assumptions[]` | Assumptions recorded during planning or execution |
| `artifacts[]` | `ArtifactRef` entries (see artifact resources) |
| `workspaceRefs[]` | `WorkspaceRef` entries produced or consumed |
| `mapPackageId?` | Deferred reference; concrete shape finalizes in the packaging lifecycle (see §Downstream Coordination) |
| `appPackageId?` | Deferred reference; concrete shape finalizes in the packaging lifecycle (see §Downstream Coordination) |
| `provenance` | `ProvenanceRecord` (see provenance resource) |
| `errors[]` | `GeoprocessingError` entries, canonical envelope |

Lifecycle visibility: `GeoprocessingWorkflowStatus` values
(`Draft`, `AwaitingClarification`, `Validated`, `AwaitingApproval`,
`AwaitingExecution`, `Running`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`) are
surfaced read-only.

### `honua://results/{result_package_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}`

Outcome-rooted view of an
[`ArtifactRef`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#artifactref).

Canonical `ArtifactRef` fields:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `artifactId` | Stable identifier (`artifact_…`) |
| `kind` | `ArtifactKind` (`Scalar`, `FeatureLayer`, `Table`, `Raster`, `File`, `Report`, `Map`, `AppBundle`) |
| `label` | Human-readable label |
| `uri` | Canonical content locator (workspace-scoped, for example `honua://workspaces/{ws}/layers/{id}`) |
| `contentType` | MIME type |
| `metadata` | Canonical metadata map |

MCP-layer lifecycle projection (not a field of `ArtifactRef`; resolved
through the workspace lifecycle service):

| Derived signal | Source |
|---|---|
| `lifecycleState` | `ArtifactLifecycleState` (`Pending`, `Available`, `Promoted`, `Expired`, `Deleted`) from the workspace lifecycle service |

Artifacts are addressable through two complementary URIs. Result-rooted
reads (`honua://results/{rpid}/artifacts/{aid}`) are outcome-centric;
workspace-rooted reads
(`honua://workspaces/{wsid}/artifacts/{aid}`) are lifecycle- and
promotion-centric. The two views address the same underlying `ArtifactRef`,
but neither inspection URI is stored in `ArtifactRef` itself.
`ArtifactRef.uri` remains the canonical content locator for the artifact
payload (for example a workspace layer path); it is not reinterpreted as
the `honua://workspaces/{workspace_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}` inspection
route. The workspace-artifact route is a separate MCP projection keyed by
workspace and artifact identity and resolved by the workspace lifecycle
service. See §Artifact Addressing Rule.

### `honua://results/{result_package_id}/provenance`

Projection of
[`ProvenanceRecord`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#provenancerecord).

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `sources[]` | Dataset sources with version and description |
| `processDefinitions[]` | Process identifiers used |
| `assumptions[]` | Assumptions recorded at execution time |
| `clarificationsAsked[]` | Questions issued to the operator |
| `clarificationsAnswered[]` | Resolved clarifications |
| `executedAt` | Execution timestamp |
| `generatedArtifactIds[]` | Artifacts produced by this execution |

`DeploymentResultPackage` (specified in the
[Technical Plan](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md))
is deferred alongside the `Automate / Deploy` workflow column in
[taxonomy.md §v1 Capability Matrix](taxonomy.md#v1-capability-matrix). It
reuses the same URI grammar (`honua://results/{id}`) once its canonical
shape finalizes in `honua-server#732`.

### `honua://results/{id}` — Publishing Result

Projection of `PublishingResultPackage` (specified in the
[Technical Plan](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md)).
The canonical shape is finalizing in `honua-server#730`; the Technical
Plan enumerates required fields at the responsibility level only. MCP
therefore describes the inspection projection by responsibility rather
than by concrete field names, consistent with the approach used for
`MapPackage` and `AppPackage` below.

**Stable identifier:** result-package ID (prefix `result_…`), shared
URI family with `AnalysisResultPackage`.

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- source lineage;
- quality report;
- published service or service definition reference (canonical
  `PublishedService` reference);
- map package when spatially relevant (canonical `MapPackage` reference);
- provenance (canonical `ProvenanceRecord`).

Edges: published service, quality report, map package, provenance. MCP
exposes compositions by canonical object name; upstream field names
finalize alongside `honua-server#730`.

### `honua://results/{id}` — Builder Result

Projection of `BuilderResultPackage` (specified in the
[Technical Plan](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md)).
The canonical shape is finalizing in the packaging lifecycle; the Technical
Plan enumerates required fields at the responsibility level only. MCP
therefore describes the inspection projection by responsibility rather
than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** result-package ID (prefix `result_…`), shared
URI family with `AnalysisResultPackage`.

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- app package (canonical `AppPackage` reference);
- map package when applicable (canonical `MapPackage` reference);
- preview artifacts (canonical `ArtifactRef` references);
- provenance (canonical `ProvenanceRecord`).

Edges: app package, map package, preview artifacts, provenance. MCP
exposes compositions by canonical object name; upstream field names
finalize alongside the packaging lifecycle (see §Downstream Coordination).

## Asset Resources

### `honua://maps/{map_package_id}`

Projection of
[`MapPackage`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#mappackage).
The canonical shape is finalizing in the packaging lifecycle; the
[`AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#mappackage)
and
[`AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md#mappackage)
sections still use different spellings for several properties
(`mapSpec` vs `honuaMapSpec`, `previewArtifactId` vs `previewArtifact`,
etc.). To avoid freezing a draft variant, MCP describes the inspection
projection by responsibility and by the canonical objects it references
rather than by concrete field names. Consumers read field names from
the canonical shape when the packaging lifecycle ticket lands.

**Stable identifier:** `mapPackageId` (prefix `map_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- package format and template binding (target identifies the canonical
  `MapTemplate`);
- source bindings (each binding is a canonical `SourceBinding`);
- styling composition (style and theme selection via canonical
  `StyleRef` and `ThemeSpec` references);
- map-spec document (the `HonuaMapSpec` style sheet used at runtime);
- initial view geometry (bounding box and CRS);
- legend, popup, and label composition;
- artifact bindings (preview artifact plus bound artifacts as canonical
  `ArtifactRef` references).

Edges: source bindings, styles, theme, template, bound artifacts, preview
artifact, initial view, legend, popup and label bindings. MCP exposes
these compositions by canonical object name; upstream field renames in
the packaging lifecycle flow through by reference without invalidating
this surface.

### `honua://apps/{app_package_id}`

Projection of
[`AppPackage`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#apppackage).
The canonical shape is finalizing in the packaging lifecycle; the
[`AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#apppackage)
and
[`AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md#apppackage)
sections still use different spellings for several properties
(`bundleArtifactId` vs `bundleArtifactRef`, `mapPackageId` vs
`mapPackageRef`, `deliveryHints` vs `deploymentHints`). To avoid
freezing a draft variant, MCP describes the inspection projection by
responsibility and by the canonical objects it references rather than
by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** `appPackageId` (prefix `app_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- target SDK declaration (v1 targets `honua-sdk-js` with a MapLibre GL JS
  runtime);
- template binding (references the app-template registry; see
  `honua://templates/apps/{id}`);
- package format and generated file manifest;
- bundle artifact reference (canonical `ArtifactRef`);
- delivery asset manifest (paths with content types);
- map binding (canonical `MapPackage` reference);
- runtime configuration schema;
- hosting and route hints (hosting mode and default route prefix);
- bound data artifacts required at runtime (canonical `ArtifactRef`
  references).

Edges: map package, bundle artifact, asset manifest, delivery hints,
runtime config schema, bound artifacts. MCP exposes compositions by
canonical object name; upstream field renames in the packaging lifecycle
flow through by reference.

### `honua://styles/{style_id}`

Projection of
[`StyleRef`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#styleref).
The canonical source currently standardizes responsibilities and examples
rather than a frozen property table, so MCP describes the inspection
projection by responsibility rather than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** style ID (prefix `style_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- thematic renderer selection;
- style preset reuse and composition;
- label and popup bindings;
- legend-generation inputs.

Edges: renderer, label, and popup composition owned by the canonical
`StyleRef`; styles are consumed by `MapPackage` style composition and by
`PublishedService` styling composition. Concrete field names finalize
upstream; the resource URI and responsibility list stay stable under
reference.

### `honua://themes/{theme_id}`

Projection of
[`ThemeSpec`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#themespec).
The canonical source currently standardizes token families and examples
rather than a frozen property table, so MCP describes the inspection
projection by responsibility rather than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** theme ID (prefix `theme_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- color-ramp tokens;
- typography tokens;
- spacing and panel chrome;
- semantic status colors.

Edges: theme composition owned by the canonical `ThemeSpec`; themes are
referenced by `MapPackage` theme selection and by `AppPackage` runtime
presentation configuration. Concrete field names finalize upstream; the
resource URI and responsibility list stay stable under reference.

### `honua://templates/maps/{map_template_id}`

Projection of
[`MapTemplate`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#maptemplate).
The canonical source currently standardizes template role and examples
rather than a frozen property table, so MCP describes the inspection
projection by responsibility rather than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** map-template ID (registry-defined; for example
`analysis_default`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- cartographic composition class (for example analysis default, dashboard,
  print-friendly review);
- named slots for `SourceBinding` placement;
- default style and theme composition;
- layout and view presets that seed `MapPackage` generation.

Edges: template composition owned by the canonical `MapTemplate`; map
templates are referenced by `MapPackage.templateId`. Concrete field names
finalize upstream; the resource URI and responsibility list stay stable
under reference.

### `honua://templates/apps/{app_template_id}`

App-template inspection view. The canonical app-template shape is not yet
owned by a single honua-server type; it surfaces through
`AppPackage.templateId` and builder-side template registries. MCP
therefore standardizes the URI and template identity only, and passes
through builder-owned inspection metadata without renaming it.

**Stable identifier:** app-template ID (registry-defined, surfaced
through `AppPackage.templateId`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- template identity carried by `AppPackage.templateId`;
- template class and label when published by the builder registry;
- additional builder-owned inspection metadata, passed through verbatim.

Edges: referenced by `AppPackage.templateId`. Concrete field names beyond
the template identity finalize alongside the packaging lifecycle ticket; until then
this resource does not create an MCP-local app-template field table.

## Promotion-Surface Resources

These resources are strictly read-only projections of promoted or deployed
state. None of them expose control operations through MCP.

### `honua://services/{published_service_id}`

Projection of
[`PublishedService`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md#publishedservice).
The canonical shape is owned by `honua-server#730`; the
`AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT` does not yet carry a `PublishedService` section,
and the `AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN` enumerates properties only at the
responsibility level. MCP therefore describes the inspection projection
by responsibility rather than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** `serviceId` (prefix `svc_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- protocol surface enumeration (for example GeoServices, OGC API
  Features, WMS, WFS, OData, tile endpoints);
- styling composition (canonical `StyleRef` references bound to the
  service);
- source-to-service lineage summary;
- refresh state (read-only lifecycle signal).

Edges: referenced by `PublishingResultPackage.publishedService`
(canonical shape deferred), consumed by `Deployment.targetRef`.
Concrete field names finalize alongside `honua-server#730`; the
resource URI and responsibility list remain stable under reference.

### `honua://deployments/{deployment_id}`

Projection of
[`Deployment`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#deployment).
The canonical shape is finalizing in `honua-server#732`; the
[`AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#deployment)
and
[`AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md#deployment)
sections still disagree on several properties (`approvalPolicyRef` vs
`approvalPolicy`; the tech plan also lists a `schedule` field not
present in the contract). MCP describes the inspection projection by
responsibility rather than by concrete field names.

**Stable identifier:** `deploymentId` (prefix `dep_…`).

**Inspection responsibilities surfaced read-only:**

- deployment kind (package class — for example `app_package`,
  `published_service`);
- target binding (`targetRef` resolves to the canonical `AppPackage`,
  `MapPackage`, or `PublishedService`; `ProcessDefinition` and
  `PipelineDefinition` targets are deferred alongside the
  `Automate / Deploy` workflow column in
  [taxonomy.md §v1 Capability Matrix](taxonomy.md#v1-capability-matrix));
- hosting mode (for example `static_site`, `managed`);
- route configuration (route prefix and resolved public URL);
- revision identifier (prefix `rev_…`);
- runtime profile (for example `browser_maplibre_js`);
- delivery artifact references (canonical `ArtifactRef`);
- injected runtime configuration (content projected, not interpreted);
- visibility scope (for example `workspace_shared`, `public`);
- auth policy reference;
- approval policy reference;
- publication lifecycle state (read-only projection).

Edges: `targetRef` → `AppPackage` | `MapPackage` | `PublishedService`
(v1); `ProcessDefinition` | `PipelineDefinition` (deferred alongside
`Automate / Deploy`); delivery artifact references → `ArtifactRef`.
Concrete field names finalize alongside `honua-server#732`; the
resource URI, responsibility list, and the full target-kind set
(including deferred kinds) stay stable under reference.

### `honua://workspaces/{workspace_id}`

Projection of
[`WorkspaceRef`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#workspaceref).

Canonical `WorkspaceRef` fields:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `workspaceId` | Stable identifier (`ws_…`) |
| `kind` | `WorkspaceKind` (`Scratch`, `Persistent`, `TempLayer`, `SavedLayer`, `ResultCollection`) |
| `label` | Human-readable label |
| `uri` | Canonical URI |
| `expiresAt?` | Expiration timestamp when applicable |

MCP-layer lifecycle projection (not a field of `WorkspaceRef`; resolved
through the workspace lifecycle service — see
[`AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT` §Workspace Lifecycle](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#workspace-lifecycle)):

| Derived signal | Source |
|---|---|
| `lifecycleState` | `WorkspaceLifecycleState` (`Active`, `Expired`, `Archived`, `Deleted`) |

### `honua://workspaces/{workspace_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}`

Workspace-rooted view of an `ArtifactRef`. The canonical fields match
the result-rooted view above; this surface is the lifecycle- and
promotion-centric read path. It is keyed by workspace and artifact
identity through lifecycle ownership context; it does not reuse
`ArtifactRef.uri` as its inspection address. All cells below are MCP-layer
projections (not fields of `ArtifactRef` itself):

| Derived signal | Source |
|---|---|
| `lifecycleState` | `ArtifactLifecycleState` (from the workspace lifecycle service) |
| `promotionSourceReady` | Boolean: source-side preconditions met (artifact state is `Available`; owning workspace kind is temporary; owning workspace is `Active` before its `ExpiresAt`, or effectively `Expired` within the cleanup grace period with `AllowPromotionBeforeCleanup` enabled for its kind — a source past `ExpiresAt + CleanupGracePeriod` is no longer eligible). Target-side checks are evaluated at promotion time and are not projected here. |
| `expiresAt?` | Expiration timestamp when applicable |
| `sourceWorkspaceKind` | `WorkspaceKind` of the owning workspace |

MCP surfaces only the source-side `promotionSourceReady` flag. Full
promotion eligibility depends on a target workspace (kind must be durable,
state must be `Active`) and is evaluated server-side when a promotion
request supplies a `targetWorkspaceId`. The underlying eligibility policy
is server-internal and not exposed through the read surface.

## Resource Relationship Model

The normative composition graph downstream consumers should code against.
Edges are expressed by canonical object name (`ArtifactRef`, `StyleRef`,
`WorkspaceRef`, `SourceBinding`, …) rather than by the scoped URIs those
objects happen to resolve to. Upstream package shapes carry artifact IDs
without a result or workspace inspection scope, so downstream consumers
resolve result-rooted artifact reads from the owning result package's
artifact fields (`AnalysisResultPackage.artifacts[]`,
`BuilderResultPackage.previewArtifacts`) and workspace-rooted artifact
reads from workspace ownership and lifecycle context (see
§Artifact Addressing Rule).

| From | To | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `results/{id}` | `ArtifactRef` | composes (analysis: `artifacts[]`; builder: `previewArtifacts`) |
| `results/{id}` | `WorkspaceRef` | references (analysis: `workspaceRefs[]`) |
| `results/{id}` | `results/{id}/provenance` | composes (all subtypes) |
| `results/{id}` | `MapPackage` | references (analysis: `mapPackageId?`; publishing/builder: `mapPackage`; deferred to packaging lifecycle) |
| `results/{id}` | `AppPackage` | references (analysis: `appPackageId?`; builder: `appPackage`; deferred to packaging lifecycle) |
| `results/{id}` | `PublishedService` | references (publishing only; canonical shape deferred to `honua-server#730`) |
| `results/{id}` | `GeoprocessingError` | composes (analysis: `errors[]`) |
| `maps/{id}` | `SourceBinding` | composes (binding list) |
| `maps/{id}` | `StyleRef` | references (style composition) |
| `maps/{id}` | `ThemeSpec` | references (theme selection) |
| `maps/{id}` | `MapTemplate` | references (template composition) |
| `maps/{id}` | `ArtifactRef` | references (preview and bound artifacts) |
| `apps/{id}` | `MapPackage` | references (map binding) |
| `apps/{id}` | `ArtifactRef` | references (bundle and bound artifacts) |
| `apps/{id}` | app template | references (template binding; canonical `AppTemplate` shape deferred) |
| `services/{id}` | `StyleRef` | references (styling bound to the service, shape deferred to `honua-server#730`) |
| `deployments/{id}` | `AppPackage` \| `MapPackage` \| `PublishedService` | references (`targetRef`); `ProcessDefinition` and `PipelineDefinition` targets deferred |
| `deployments/{id}` | `ArtifactRef` | references (delivery artifacts) |
| `ArtifactRef` | `workspaces/{wsid}/artifacts/{aid}` | inspected through workspace ownership and lifecycle context (not via `ArtifactRef.uri`) |
| `ArtifactRef` | `results/{rpid}/artifacts/{aid}` | resolves through the owning result package's artifact fields (`AnalysisResultPackage.artifacts[]`, `BuilderResultPackage.previewArtifacts`) |

Expressing edges by canonical object name keeps the graph stable when
upstream field names evolve. Upstream field additions or renames in
`MapPackage`, `AppPackage`, `Deployment`, and `PublishedService` (still
finalizing in `honua-server#730`/`#731`/`#732`) flow through by
reference.

### Artifact Addressing Rule

The canonical `ArtifactRef` (§AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT) carries its own
content `uri` (for example
`honua://workspaces/ws_123/layers/candidate_parcels`). That locator points
to the artifact payload within the workspace namespace; it is not the MCP
inspection URI `honua://workspaces/{wsid}/artifacts/{aid}`. Package shapes
that reference artifacts (`MapPackage`, `AppPackage`, `Deployment`) carry
artifact references through canonical fields whose concrete names are
finalizing in `honua-server#731`/`#732`. Regardless of final spelling,
these references identify artifacts without embedding a result-package or
workspace inspection URI. Consumers therefore:

1. Resolve the artifact ID to its canonical `ArtifactRef` through a
   known ownership scope — the owning result package's artifact fields
   or the workspace lifecycle service (`ListArtifacts`) — when they
   need payload information such as `kind`, `contentType`, `metadata`,
   or the content locator `uri`.
2. Use the result-rooted path
   (`honua://results/{rpid}/artifacts/{aid}`) when the owning result
   package scope is already known from context. This applies to any
   result package that carries `ArtifactRef` fields:
   `AnalysisResultPackage.artifacts[]` and
   `BuilderResultPackage.previewArtifacts`.
3. Use the workspace-rooted path
   (`honua://workspaces/{wsid}/artifacts/{aid}`) only when the owning
   workspace identity is already known from context or resolved through
   the workspace lifecycle service.

MCP does not synthesize a scoped inspection URI from `ArtifactRef.uri`, and
it does not infer result or workspace scope from an unscoped artifact ID
alone. Scoped inspection routes exist only where result ownership or
workspace ownership is carried by the containing object or resolved by the
workspace lifecycle service.

**Resolution path for package-embedded artifact references.** Package
resources (`MapPackage`, `AppPackage`, `Deployment`) carry artifact
identifiers through canonical fields. No unscoped artifact lookup
exists in the public contract (`WorkspaceService` exposes
`ListArtifacts` scoped by workspace; there is no `GetArtifact`
by ID alone). Consumers resolve these identifiers to full
`ArtifactRef` objects through a known ownership context. The
target resolution sequence is: read the package resource → extract
the artifact identifier → match the identifier against `ArtifactRef`
objects obtained from the owning result package's artifact fields
(`AnalysisResultPackage.artifacts[]`,
`BuilderResultPackage.previewArtifacts`) or from the workspace
lifecycle service (`ListArtifacts` on the owning workspace) → use
workspace ownership to construct the workspace-rooted inspection URI
(`honua://workspaces/{wsid}/artifacts/{aid}`) for lifecycle state.

Workspace ownership is resolvable through two mechanisms, neither of
which is unconditionally available today:

1. **Content URI convention** — `ArtifactRef.uri` (when populated)
   carries a workspace-scoped path (for example
   `honua://workspaces/ws_123/layers/candidate_parcels`) from which
   the owning workspace identity can be derived by convention.
   However, `ArtifactRef.Uri` is nullable in the canonical shape and
   `AddArtifactAsync` permits omitting it, so this path is available
   only when the producing workflow populates the content locator.
2. **Planned `workspaceRef` field** — the
   [Technical Plan](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/AI_OPERATOR_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md)
   specifies `workspaceRef` as a planned `ArtifactRef` field that
   will provide explicit workspace ownership. This field has not
   finalized upstream.

Until at least one mechanism is unconditionally present on every
`ArtifactRef` returned by the server, workspace-rooted lifecycle
inspection for a package-embedded artifact is available only when the
artifact's content URI is populated or `workspaceRef` is present.
Consumers should treat the absence of both as a deferred-resolution
case and fall back to the `ArtifactRef` payload fields (`kind`,
`contentType`, `metadata`) available from any scoped read that
returned the `ArtifactRef`.

## Capability Coverage

Coverage status (`v1`, `deferred`, `--`, `excluded`) is single-sourced in
[taxonomy.md §v1 Capability Matrix](taxonomy.md#v1-capability-matrix). This
document does not republish coverage columns or duplicate the status
vocabulary. The mapping below is a pure resource-family-to-workflow-family
grouping so downstream packaging and deployment consumers can locate the
resource families each workflow reads; coverage status for any given
cell is read from the taxonomy matrix.

| Resource family | Workflow families consuming it |
|---|---|
| `results`, `results/{id}/artifacts`, `results/{id}/provenance` | Analyze, Publish Data, Build App, Automate / Deploy |
| `maps`, `styles`, `themes`, `templates/maps` | Analyze, Publish Data, Build App, Automate / Deploy |
| `apps`, `templates/apps` | Analyze, Build App, Automate / Deploy |
| `services` | Publish Data, Automate / Deploy |
| `deployments` | Publish Data, Build App, Automate / Deploy |
| `workspaces`, `workspaces/{id}/artifacts` | Analyze, Publish Data, Build App, Automate / Deploy |

Whether any cell is `v1`, `deferred`, `--`, or `excluded` follows the
canonical taxonomy matrix and is not repeated here. When coverage
changes, the taxonomy matrix is the single edit point.

## Error Model

MCP resource surfaces reuse the canonical
[`GeoprocessingError`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/developer/AI_OPERATOR_CONTRACT.md#geoprocessingerror)
envelope verbatim:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `GeoprocessingErrorKind` (`ValidationFailed`, `AuthorizationDenied`, `UnknownDataset`, `UnknownProcess`, `ExecutionFailed`, `Timeout`, `Cancelled`, `OutputBindingFailed`) |
| `message` | Human-readable summary |
| `stepId?` | Plan step identifier when applicable |
| `violations[]` | Structured validation failures (`code`, `message`, `fieldPath`) |

No parallel codes, envelopes, or MCP-specific error taxonomy are defined.

## Non-Goals

These items are explicitly out of scope for MCP resource surfaces and align
with the non-goals in
[taxonomy.md §Non-Goals](taxonomy.md#non-goals).

### 1. No State Mutation

MCP resources never mutate server state. Publishing, promotion, approval,
deployment rollout, and revision cuts are owned by gRPC services and
server-internal workflows.

### 2. No Replacement of gRPC Execution Contracts

Resources project canonical shapes; they do not redefine service methods
or execution semantics. Execution contracts stay with `geospatial-grpc`.

### 3. No Exposure of Server Internals

Worker routing, queue state, provider adapters, storage backends,
eligibility-policy evaluation, and secret material are server-internal
and must not leak through resource projections.

### 4. No AI Data Editing

Per [ADR-0028](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/blob/main/docs/contributor/adr/0028-ai-data-editing-not-allowed.md)
AI may inspect but must not autonomously edit source data. Resource reads
do not grant edit paths.

### 5. No Parallel Taxonomy, URI Scheme, or Error Envelope

Family names, capability matrix, URI scheme (`honua://`), and error
envelope (`GeoprocessingError`) stay single-sourced. Alternative schemes
(for example `mcp://`) are not introduced.

### 6. No Inlined Canonical Shapes

Canonical shapes (`AnalysisResultPackage`, `MapPackage`, `AppPackage`,
`StyleRef`, `ThemeSpec`, `MapTemplate`, `SourceBinding`, `Deployment`,
`PublishedService`, `ProvenanceRecord`, `ArtifactRef`, `WorkspaceRef`,
`GeoprocessingError`) are referenced, not reproduced. When an upstream
shape finalizes (e.g., `MapPackage` in the packaging lifecycle ticket),
the resource contract absorbs the change by reference without local
redefinition.

## Observable Signals

Implementations should preserve the telemetry the taxonomy document relies
on and add resource-level signals where behavior changes:

- **Workflow status visibility** -- emit `GeoprocessingWorkflowStatus`
  on result reads.
- **Publication state visibility** -- emit `Deployment.publicationState`
  and `PublishedService.refreshStatus` on promotion-surface reads.
- **Artifact lifecycle state** -- emit `ArtifactLifecycleState` on
  artifact reads through either URI view; emit derived
  `promotionSourceReady` on workspace-rooted artifact reads only
  (source-side preconditions; result-rooted reads do not resolve
  promotion readiness).
- **Workspace lifecycle state** -- emit `WorkspaceLifecycleState` on
  workspace reads.
- **Per-family capability coverage** -- emit coverage flags aligned to
  the family-by-workflow table above.
- **Non-goal assertions** -- emit rejection or redirection signals when a
  request attempts state mutation, protocol-specific control, or
  server-internal introspection through a resource surface.

These signals support operational telemetry without prescribing an
instrumentation framework, consistent with
[taxonomy.md §Observable Signals](taxonomy.md#observable-signals).

## Downstream Coordination

This contract unblocks the following consumers; they own their own
implementation details.

| Consumer | Dependency |
|---|---|
| [`honua-server#730`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/issues/730) | Publishing lifecycle surfaces |
| [`honua-server#731`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/issues/731) | Map, app, and artifact packaging |
| [`honua-server#732`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server/issues/732) | Deployment lifecycle surfaces |
| [`honua-sdk-js#21`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-sdk-js/issues/21) | JS SDK resource consumption |
| [`honua-sdk-js#29`](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-sdk-js/issues/29) | Map and app packaging in the JS runtime |

Sequencing: the resource grammar, inspection fields, lifecycle visibility,
and relationship graph above are the stable interface. Downstream tickets
finalize the concrete canonical shapes: `PublishedService` and
`PublishingResultPackage` in `honua-server#730`; `MapPackage` and
`AppPackage` in the packaging lifecycle ticket (`honua-server#731` per the
Technical Plan; the AI Operator Contract references `#730` in some
sections — downstream consumers should follow the ticket that lands the
concrete type).
Resource URIs remain valid because they reference those shapes by name.
